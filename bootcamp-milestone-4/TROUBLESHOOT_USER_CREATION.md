# Troubleshooting MongoDB User Creation

## Common Issues When "Add User" Button Doesn't Work

### Check These Required Fields:

1. **Username Field** (REQUIRED):
   - Make sure you've entered a username (e.g., `joshuapanicker_db_user`)
   - The field should NOT be empty
   - Username must be at least 1 character

2. **Password Field** (REQUIRED):
   - You MUST either:
     - Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" button, OR
     - Enter your own password manually
   - The password field cannot be empty
   - If you autogenerated, make sure you copied it!

3. **Built-in Role** (REQUIRED):
   - You've already done this: "Read and write to any database" shows "1 selected" ✅
   - This is correct - you don't need to change it

4. **Custom Roles Section**:
   - You can IGNORE this section - leave it empty
   - This is optional and not required

5. **Specific Privileges Section**:
   - You can IGNORE this section - leave it empty
   - This is optional and not required

## Step-by-Step Checklist:

- [ ] Username field is filled in (e.g., `joshuapanicker_db_user`)
- [ ] Password is set (either autogenerated or manually entered)
- [ ] Built-in role shows "Read and write to any database" with "1 selected"
- [ ] Custom Roles section is empty (that's fine)
- [ ] Specific Privileges section is empty (that's fine)
- [ ] Click "Add User" button at the bottom

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check for error messages**: Look for red text or error messages on the page
2. **Try refreshing the page**: Sometimes the form gets stuck
3. **Check your browser console**: Press F12, go to Console tab, look for errors
4. **Try a different browser**: Sometimes browser extensions can interfere
5. **Make sure you're logged in**: Check that you're still logged into MongoDB Atlas

## Alternative: Try the "Autogenerate Secure Password" Button

If you're having trouble with the password field:
1. Click the "Autogenerate Secure Password" button
2. A password will be generated and displayed
3. **COPY IT IMMEDIATELY** - you won't see it again!
4. Then try clicking "Add User"

## What the Form Should Look Like:

```
Username: [joshuapanicker_db_user]  ← FILLED IN
Password: [Autogenerate Secure Password] or [Your password]  ← MUST BE SET
Built-in Role: Read and write to any database (1 selected)  ← YOU HAVE THIS
Custom Roles: (empty - that's fine)
Specific Privileges: (empty - that's fine)

[Add User] button at the bottom
```

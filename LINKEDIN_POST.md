🚀 **From Static HTML to Full-Stack Next.js: My Personal Website Evolution**

I'm excited to share my journey transforming a simple HTML/CSS portfolio into a fully functional, database-driven web application! This project represents my growth from basic frontend development to building modern, interactive web experiences.

**The Evolution:**
Starting with static HTML and CSS, I progressively enhanced the website through multiple milestones, learning and implementing new technologies at each stage. The final result is a production-ready Next.js application deployed on Vercel.

**Key Features & Technologies:**

✨ **Frontend:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router architecture
- React 19 with Server and Client Components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive CSS Modules for styling
- Dynamic routing for blog posts (`/blog/[slug]`)

💾 **Backend & Database:**
- MongoDB Atlas integration with Mongoose ODM
- Server-side data fetching for blogs and portfolio projects
- RESTful API routes for comment submissions
- Real-time comment system with formatted timestamps

📧 **Interactive Features:**
- Contact form with EmailJS integration
- Form validation and error handling
- React Hooks (useState) for state management
- Client-side interactivity with event handlers

📝 **Content Management:**
- Dynamic blog system with preview cards
- Individual blog post pages with full content
- Comment system with user input and timestamps
- Portfolio showcase with tech stack tags
- Resume page with detailed experience

**Technical Highlights:**
- Server Components for optimal performance
- Client Components for interactive features
- Environment variable management for security
- MongoDB connection pooling and error handling
- EmailJS service integration for contact form
- Vercel deployment with automatic CI/CD
